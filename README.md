## Image-Based HAR
Transfer learning techniques were used to build an image classification model that recognizes various classes of human activity. 
The model was trained on images from the Stanford 40 dataset. You can find out more information about the data

We used a only a portion of the full dataset, training on images from
the following ten action classes.<br>
### Classes
- Applauding
- Climbing
- Cooking
- Feeding a horse
- Holding an umbrella
- Jumping
- Playing guitar
- Riding a bike
- Riding a horse
- Walking the dog
The resulting model achieved a classification accuracy of 96%.
